        ##WINDOWS EXPLOIT COD
        process.h, string.h, winbase.h, windows.h, winsock2.h
        
        
        #LINUX EXPLOIT CODE
        arpa/inet.h, fcntl.h, netdb.h, netinet/in.h, 
        sys/sockt.h, sys/types.h, unistd.h

        Finish some time later about gcc x-compiling and 32/64 bit xcompiling and compiling in debian to .exe
